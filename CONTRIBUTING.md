# Contribution Guidelines
Thank you for considering contributing to our Jetpack Compose UI Component Library! To maintain consistency and uphold the principles of our library, we have outlined the following guidelines for contributors:

## 1. Stateless Composables:
Principle: All contributed composables should be stateless.

Explanation: Statelessness promotes reusability and ensures that the components can be easily integrated into various UI scenarios without introducing unnecessary complexity. State management should be handled by the consuming code.

```
Example of a Stateless Composable
@Composable
fun SimpleButton(text: String, onClick: () -> Unit) {
    Button(onClick = onClick) {
        Text(text)
    }
}

@Composable
fun StatelessScreen() {
    val text = "Click me!"
    SimpleButton(text = text) { /* Handle click event */ }
}
In this example, the SimpleButton composable is stateless. It receives the text and onClick event through its parameters and does not manage any state internally.
```
## 2. Clear Documentation and Examples:
Principle: Provide comprehensive documentation and usage examples.

Explanation: Ensure that your contribution includes clear and concise documentation outlining the purpose, usage, and any specific considerations for the composable. Include code examples to help developers understand how to integrate and customize the component.

Example:
```
/**
 * A brief description of the composable.
 *
 * @param parameter1 Description of the first parameter.
 * @param parameter2 Description of the second parameter.
 */

@Composable
fun DocumentedComponent(parameter1: Type, parameter2: Type) {
    // Composable logic with comments for clarity
}
```
## 3. Code Style and Naming Conventions:
Principle: Adhere to consistent code style and naming conventions.

Explanation: Consistency in coding style ensures that the library maintains a unified and readable codebase. Follow the established Jetpack Compose coding conventions, and use clear and descriptive names for your composables and functions.

Example:
```
// Follow consistent code style and naming conventions
@Composable
fun MyStyledComponent() {
    // Composable logic here
}
```
## 4. Dependency-Free:
Principle: Composables should be free from dependencies on third-party libraries.

Explanation: To maintain a lightweight and easily integratable library, avoid introducing external dependencies. This minimizes potential conflicts, reduces the library's footprint, and ensures a smoother integration experience for developers using the library.

Example:
```
// Avoid using third-party libraries in your composable code
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxSize
import androidx.compose.material.Text
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable

@Composable
fun MyDependencyFreeComponent() {
    // Composable logic without third-party dependencies
    Text(text = "Hello, Jetpack Compose!", modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize())
}
```
## 5. Efficiency and Recomposition:
Principle: Composables should be efficient and minimize unnecessary recomposition.

Explanation: Efficiency is key to a performant UI. Compose encourages a reactive programming model, but unnecessary recomposition can impact performance. Avoid recomposing the entire composable when only a specific part needs an update.

Example:
```
@Composable
fun MyEfficientComponent(data: String) {
    // Efficient logic with minimal recomposition
   
}
```
## 6. Accessibility Considerations:
Principle: Consider accessibility in your composables.

Explanation: Aim to create UI components that are accessible to users with disabilities. Use appropriate accessibility attributes and ensure that your composables provide a meaningful experience for all users.

Example:
```
// Consider accessibility attributes in your composables
@Composable
fun AccessibleComponent() {
    // Composable logic with accessibility considerations
}
```
## 7. Versioning and Compatibility:
Principle: Be mindful of library versioning and compatibility.

Explanation: If your contribution introduces changes that might impact the library's compatibility or API, clearly communicate any versioning considerations. Follow semantic versioning principles to maintain a predictable release process.

Example:
```
// Communicate versioning considerations in your pull request
// Update library version if necessary
```
By following these guidelines and contributing thoughtfully, help us make this Jetpack Compose component library even more valuable for everyone!
